## 🚀 Description about our project

The Khmer Fingerspelling Interpreter is a project aimed at developing a real-time recognition system for Khmer fingerspelling. 
This system is designed to enhance communication between deaf individuals and non-signers.

## 🚀 Features

- Supports classification of 33 Khmer consonant signs using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques.
  - Macine Learning: Random Forest(RF), K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Logistic Regression(LR), Support Vector Machine(SVM).
  - Deep Learinng: Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), Residual Network(ResNet).
- Provides an interactive user interface developed with Streamlit.
- Utilizes a custom Khmer font to enhance native text display.

## ⚡ Tools and Technologies used 

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: OpenCV, Scikit-Learn, Streamlit, Mediapipe
- IDE: VSCode
- Platform: Google Colab (for model training and testing)
